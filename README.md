This project was to create a program that would allow for the time settings to be changed and allow for it to display the time. Both in standard (am/pm) or military time. 


I dont think I did too particularly well. I had to set up a good time and get tutored from someone close by to really start to have a good understanding of this. Obviously, It is very amatuer. 


There are multiple places I could enhance my code. I would like to be able to find a way to enable an actual time zone identifier, Like where it would pull your actual time and allow for it to set to that. This would allow for a much easier user experience, instead of placing multiple inputs in. 

I found the entire project to be a bit overwhelming. I had to get some help of someone close to help guide me through some of this. The course itself is a bit rough, and hard to digest. But having someone break it down and help you understand it was a game changer for me. I plan to take some small courses on the side, at my own pace, to allow me to really dive deeper into C++. I believe i will also need to keep someone who is experienced in C++ in my corner for a little while. 

This can help me create programs for my current work place and maybe turn some manual tasks into automatic ones. When I reach my final goal of getting into cyber security, Knowing these skills can help me much more. I will be able to understand some code and alter or reuse them to be recycled.

I believe i have tried to make it as efficient and concise as possible. I tried to break in into very clear pieces, even so this still seems to be a very confusing program. This program may be able to be input into pieces of hardware and allow a display to be used that way.
